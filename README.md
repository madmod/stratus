# Goals
- Have fun!
- Make a self bootstrapping k8s cluster.
- Learn NEW STUFF! (Don't just use the same old patterns!)
- Make mistakes!

# Non goals.
- Be perfect.
- Get it right the first time.

# Ideas
- Make bootstrapping a continuous process. Run a virtual env which is identical to the eventual physical env. Have an out of band process to migrate from physical to virtual.
